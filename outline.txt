Makefile
    Do docker compose up: calls the docker-compose.yml

docker-compose
    Builds every container in the correct order (DB -> Wordpress -> NGINX)
        e.g.
            services:
                wordpress:
                    build: ./wordpress      # when ./wordpress/Dockerfile
    Creates every volume (based on the volume: in the file ?)
    Defines the correct configs
    
Dockerfile
    Defines the base image:
        FROM ubuntu:22.04 (Alpine/Debian)
    Downloads the necessary app dependencies:
        RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
    Tell what port this service is listening:
        EXPOSE 8000
    Start running the program:
        CMD ["./myapp"]


Dockerfiles: NGINX, WordPress, MariaDB

- Have the two users harcoded into the DB Dockerfile so that it creates the DB volume with them.
- 




In compose:

depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
        restart: true

HEALTHCHECK in Dockerfiles
